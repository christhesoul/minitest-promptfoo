This is a Ruby gem that provides a thin Ruby wrapper around the Promptfoo prompt testing framework.

The aim of this project is to provide a Minitest aesthetic to testing prompts that live in a repo.

Our aim is not to recreate Promptfoo in Ruby, but rather to harness the power of Promptfoo while keeping the joy of writing Ruby.

Your tasks will probably involve providing a Ruby to interface to Promptfoo features. This generally involves
coercing code within a Minitest-style assertion into some YAML that we then provide when shelling out to the
Promptfoo command line tool.

Always bias towards simple and beautiful Ruby code.
